=== WebAuthnManager class has too many responsibility

Q: `WebAuthnManager` provides two distinct functions: registration and authentication.
This can be inconvenient for classes that only need authentication function, as they must still configure attestation settings required only for registration when instantiating `WebAuthnManager`.

A: Please consider using `WebAuthnRegistrationManager` and `WebAuthnAuthenticationManager`, each dedicated to either registration or authentication.
